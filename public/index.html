        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>
          Hello! My name is Fernando and I am a 2021 UC San Diego computer engineering graduate who is highly interested
          in artificial intelligence, machine learning, web development, and printed circuit board designing.
          My curiosity in computer science and engineering began back in high school when I was sitting in my algebra
          class, when I was introduced to the P vs NP problem.
        </p>
        <p>Since then, I have had the privilege of working as
          <a href="http://sopac-csrc.ucsd.edu/">a research assistant</a>,
          <a href="https://rocketproplab.org/">a student lead avionics project</a>,
          and was the developer behind <a href="https://kappasigmaucsd.org/#/">my fraternity chapters website.</a>
          My main focus currently is finding a new challenging experience, where I can apply my skills as a developer
          and engineer to exceed expectations.
        </p>
        <p>Here are some of the technologies I've been working with recently:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Node.js</li>
          <li>Javascript</li>
          <li>React</li>
          <li>Altium</li>
          <li>Quartus</li>
          <li>ModelSim</li>

            Over the course of a year, I worked with 3 undergraduates to redesign, test, and implement Avionics devices
            to construct an engine controller unit, GPS, and a command/recovery system. We produced a BJT transistor
            array PCB to properly toggle relays and an INA326 instrumentation amplifier array PCB to amplify pressure
            transducer readings
